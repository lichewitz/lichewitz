Hi there! My name is Murilo GonÃ§alves da Rocha, I'm a brazilian chemist specialized in environmental remediation, experimental design and modeling of experimental data, and more recently, data analysis and implementation of machine learning algorithms. Currently, I work at LabGEO planning and executing laboratory research on environmental remediation. I'm a very data-oriented scientist, and professinally, few things brings greater joy like than when you are able to find useful and interesting patterns in data. I intend to use this github page to showcase a few examples, as well as a few personal projects.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on environmental remediation: optimization of in situ remediation procedures based on geochemical data
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot of statistics. I enjoy the technical aspects of the algorithms I implement
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data science projects regarding natural sciences and interesting real world problems
